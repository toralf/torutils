Circuit handshake stats since last time:
Clean shutdown finished. Exiting.
Configured to measure statistics. Look for the *-stats files that will first be written to the data directory in 24 hours from now.
DoS mitigation since startup:
Heartbeat:
I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit
Included configuration file or directory at recursion level
Including configuration file "/etc/tor/conf.d//
 is newer than any recommended version, according to the directory authorities.

New control connection opened from
No circuits are opened. Relaxed timeout for circuit

Our directory information is no longer up-to-date enough to build circuits: We're missing descriptors for

Received circuit padding stop command for unknown machine.

These two versions should be binary compatible.
Tried to establish rendezvous on non-edge circuit
We now have enough directory information to build circuits
We were built to run on a 64-bit CPU, with OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later, but with a version of OpenSSL that apparently lacks accelerated support for the NIST P-224 and P-256 groups. Building openssl with such support (using the enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 option when configuring it) would make ECDH much faster.
